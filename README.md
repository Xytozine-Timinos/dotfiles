## About

___DEVELOPED ON UBUNTU 26.04 AND LINUX MINT - zena (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)___<BR>

__Project Size__<BR>

- dotfiles repo: 35 ~> 36 Megabytes<BR>
- TOTAL (dotfiles, dependencies, build from source apps): ~800 Megabytes<BR>

__About:__<BR>
Been brewing since late __March 2024__ on Github<BR>
Repo officially started in __1st June 2024__ on Github<BR>
Moved to __Codeberg__ on 14/7/2026 <BR>

The purpose of this project is to share my configs, my ideas as openly as possible. Feel free to open a VM or try it on your own machine!<BR>
<BR>
__If you encounter any issue just open an issue on Codeberg, thanks!__<BR>
<BR>

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommend for developers, ricers or people who want more technical to take a look at the `.config/rofi/rofi-modules`, scripts that are lied in `.config/hypr/scripts` to get some of my ideas.

> [!NOTE]
> This dotfiles repo is coded and made on the latest version of Ubuntu, so it is expected to have some compatibility issues with older versions of Ubutu and other distros like Debian or something like that so beware. Arch is fine though.
> I suggest that if you use Debian based distros like Linux Mint, Ubuntu, use ([pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/)) to solve the issue.

## Preview
Wallpaper: aris (armed) & kei from blue archive by feilingdong <BR>
Hyprland with dotfiles options (see below at the configuration section):
```
bar_color=black
bar_expressive_style=true
bar_dynamic_style=true
bar_dynamic_round_style=true
bar_top=false
```
This one I edited on GIMP to make the background match the bar, making it disappear <BR>
This is on a ultra-wide monitor (2560x1080) <BR>

## Installation

Install the font:

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure make backups of your dotfiles before install this

- FONT: Jetbrainsmono Nerd Font Regular and Jetbrainsmono Nerd Font Bold ([link to download fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))

> [!NOTE]
> `Picom` is a dependency that needs to be installed and build from source in order to work correctly.
> [Install and build Picom from source, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THERE](https://github.com/yshui/picom)

> [!NOTE]
> From what I have experienced, the terminal emulator `kitty` starts quite slow when installed from apt (from apt is 0.50 seconds, from source is 0.15 seconds), so it is highly recommend to build it from source.
> [Link to build kitty from source](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/build/)

My way to install and build kitty from source:

```
mkdir testenv && cd testenv
git clone https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty.git && cd kitty
./dev.sh build
ln -s ~/testenv/kitty/kitty/launcher/kitty ~/.local/bin/kitty
ln -s ~/testenv/kitty/kitty/launcher/kitten ~/.local/bin/kitten
```

To maintain kitty, I created a file in kitty repo directory and named it as `update_kitty.sh` and give it permission to run `chmod +x update_kitty.sh`

```
#!/bin/bash

git pull
./dev.sh deps
./dev.sh build --debug
sudo rm -rf ~/go/ && echo "Build deps removed!"
```

Install rofimoji, waypaper via pipx

```
sudo apt install pipx
pipx install waypaper
pipx install rofimoji
```

Install neovim via ([pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/)):
```
pacstall -U
pacstall -Up
pacstall -I neovim
```

Install Hyprland dependencies

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cppiber/hyprland
sudo apt update
sudo apt install $(curl -s https://codeberg.org/xytozine/dotfiles/main/dependencies.txt)
```

Install oh-my-zsh (command taken from the official [page](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh))

```
sudo apt install curl
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Install zsh plugins (zsh-autopair zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting fzf-tab)

```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/zsh-autopair.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
git clone https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab.git
```

Install the dotfiles

```
cd ~
git clone https://codeberg.org/Xytozine/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .
sudo updatedb # Update find/locate command
i3-msg restart # If using i3 (Not recommended since no longer support)
hyprctl dispatch restart # Hyprland
```
## Hyprland Plugins (Not recommend due to mismatch ABI hell)

This dotfiles supports hyprland plugins such as `hyprbars, Hyprspace, hyprgrass`

In order to install and use these plugins, please install the `hyprpm` package first.

```
sudo apt install hyprpm
```

Then re-log in the Hyprland environment<BR>

Opent the terminal and install these for the best Hyprland experience.

```
hyprpm update
hyprpm add https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins # add basic plugins such as hyprbars
hyprpm add https://github.com/KZDKM/Hyprspace # macOs like workspace switching
hyprpm add https://github.com/horriblename/hyprgrass # For touch screen users
hyprpm enable hyprgrass
hyprpm enable Hyprspace
hyprpm enable hyprbars
```

Then `win + shift + r` to reload Hyprland if 2 or more bars spawned.

## USAGE ([link to the wiki (still under development)](https://github.com/Xgameisdabest/dotfiles/wiki))

THIS IS ___NOT___ YOUR NORMAL TYPICAL ___DESKTOP___ (the desktop interface on W\*ndows, macOS, Gnome, KDE, LXQT, XFCE4...) but a ___TILING WINDOW MANAGER___ (i3, hyprland, sway, dwm...).

It is highly recommend to go on the web to search [what is a tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) and its usage so you can know the basics of a ___TILING WINDOW MANAGER___.

Here is the list of keybinds for this dotfiles (all of this can be viewed in the desktop itself):

- Press (win/mod + shift + r) to reload the tiling window manager

> [!NOTE]
> helpful tip: if you are using a laptop and an external monitor, plug the connection cable (HDMI, VGA, DP) to the laptop and use this key combination, it should cast to the external monitor on reload. ___Do it multiple times if the bar is glitching!___

- Press (win/mod + =) to open the keybinds menu
- Press (win/mod + i) to open the settings menu (require some knowledge of bash scripting and specific program config syntax)
- Press (win/mod + r) to open the app menu (alternatively, this can be launched via clicking on the app title on the bar)
- Press (win/mod + s) to open the web search menu
- Press (win/mod + -) to toggle the visibility of the bar
- Press (win/mod + [1 -> 0]) to change the workspace
- Press (win/mod + shift + [1 -> 0] to move/drop the focused window to the selected number workspace)
- Press (win/mod + v) to toggle between tiling mode (the mode that place Bindoj/programs side by side) and floating mode (the mode you can drag Bindoj/programs around by hold left click on the title)
- Press (win/mod + tab) to open the opened Bindoj menu, select and press ENTER to switch to the opened Bindoj
- Press (win/mod + ARROW_KEYS) to change focus between the tiled windows.
- Press (ctrl + win/mod + ARROW_LEFT/ARROW_RIGHT) to send the focused window to the next numerical workspace.

<BR>

You can now create your own ```zshrc``` in this dotfiles without overriding it.<BR>
Here's how:<BR>
```
Create a file name called zsh-custom-config under the dtf-config directory:
mkdir ~/.config/dtf-config/
touch ~/.config/dtf-config/zsh-custom-config
```
<BR>
Follow the zsh online guide/manual to learn to how to config your own zsh setup<BR>

<BR>

>[!NOTE]
>All of your zsh custom config will override the original shipped with this dotfiles

<BR>

__FOR HYPRLAND__<BR>

Now support custom configs. <BR>

At first, you might want to create the directory:

```
mkdir ~/.config/hypr/custom/
```

>[!NOTE]
>This works the same with the lua version, all you need to do is create the .lua config file.

Put your configs such as Hyprland configs and env vars, also executables into this directory: <BR>

```
#FOR EXAMPLE
~/.config/hypr/custom
               ├── system.conf
               ├── user_custom_config.conf
               ├── startup_script.sh
               ├── it_can_be_anything_that_you_want.conf
               └── window.conf
```

Hyprland will automatically scan that directory and override any default settings that this dotfiles come with (__for .conf files__). <BR>
For .sh files, such as startup scripts, you need to create a .conf file such as `startup.conf` or any other name, then put the script you want to exec in the __.conf__ file.<BR>

```
#EXAMPLE
# Custom config goes here.
# Use the custom directory for your own thing
# For example:
# exec = ~/.config/hypr/custom/your_own_thing.sh
#
# Maybe setup some env vars for a specific machine:
# env = RADV_PERFTEST,gpl,aco
#
# or a Hyprland setting you do not want:
# misc {
# force_default_wallpaper = 1
#}
```

__Have fun__
